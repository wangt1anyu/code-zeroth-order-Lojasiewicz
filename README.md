### 
code for experiments in the paper "Convergence Rates of Zeroth-order Gradient Descent for ≈Åojasiewicz Functions'' by Tianyu Wang and Yasong Feng. 

The file "exp.ipynb" contains codes for experiments in the main text of the paper, and the file  "exp-linesearch.ipynb" contains codes for experiments in the appendix of the paper. 

Running "exp.ipynb" and "exp-linesearch.ipynb" will create raw data in the "raw_data" folder. After the raw data are in place, running "plotting.ipynb" and "plotting-linesearch.ipynb" will save plots in the "figures" folder. 

You may need to manually create the folder "raw_data" and or "figures" on your local repo. 

Please contact wangtianyu@fudan.edu.cn or ysfeng20@fudan.edu.cn if you have any questions.
